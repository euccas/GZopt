Before starting compression, zlib <bold>accumulates data</bold> in an <bold>input buffer</bold> and starts compression when the input buffer is full. Default input buffer size is 8KB. 

The reason of having the input buffer is that zlib wonâ€™t generate any output data until 16K data symbols have been generated in the <bold>literal buffer</bold> (default size of the literal buffer is 16K, see the [next section](#zlib_literal_buffer) for details about the literal buffer). Therefore starting compression with very short length of data has no benefit. Using the input buffer improves the efficiency of I/O.

The default input buffer size can be changed using <code>gzbuffer</code> function.
