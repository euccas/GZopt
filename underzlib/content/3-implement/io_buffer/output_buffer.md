For outputting the compressed data, zlib uses two buffers: a <bold>pending buffer</bold>, and an <bold>output buffer</bold>. The data flow is as shown in the following figure:

![Output Buffer](./output_buffer.png)

Upon initialization, zlib creates a pending buffer (default size is 36K), and an output buffer (default size is 8K). The output data are first <bold>accumulated in pending buffer</bold>, and then get <bold>copied to output buffer</bold>, finally be written to the output compressed zip or gz files.

Data are copied from pending buffer to output buffer in function <code>flush_pending</code>. This function is called when the literal buffer is full, which means a block of data has been processed. Itâ€™s also called in some other cases when flushing a block is needed. The length of data copied to the output buffer is limited by the available space in output buffer.

When the <bold>output buffer is full</bold>, or when <bold>flush signal</bold> is issued, zlib writes output buffer to zip or gz files.

zlib uses counters <code>pending_out</code> and <code>avail_out</code> to record how many bytes are available in pending buffer and output buffer. Counter value <code>0</code> means the buffer is full.
