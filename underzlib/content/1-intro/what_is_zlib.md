[zlib](https://zlib.net/) is a free, open source software library for <bold>lossless data compression</bold> and <bold>decompression</bold>.
It was written by [Jean-loup Gailly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-loup_Gailly) (compression) and [Mark Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Adler) (decompression), in C language. The first version of zlib was released in May 1995. Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler also wrote the code for <bold>gzip</bold> (GNU zip). Under the hood, gzip uses zlib library. 

To date, zlib is mainly maintained by Mark Adler, and its recent updates and version releases can all be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/madler/zlib). Mark Adler is also active on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/zlib) to answer technical questions about zlib and gzip.

More than many software applications and libraries utilizes zlib. If paying attention, you can find zlib almost everywhere, in operation systems, internet services, streaming services, document editors, and more. This is [an incomplete list](http://zlib.net/apps.html) of those applications.

The specification of zlib achieved official Internet RFC ([Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)) status in May 1996. 

* [RFC 1950](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt): zlib compressed data format
* [RFC 1951](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt): deflate compressed data format
* [RFC 1952](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt): gzip file format
