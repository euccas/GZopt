      <description>The sliding window is used to examine the input data sequence, and to maintain the historical data that serve as the dictionary. In other words, the dictionary is a portion of the previously appeared and encoded data.
The sliding window consists of two parts: a search buffer, and a look-ahead buffer. The search buffer contains the dictionary - the recent encoded data, and the look-ahead buffer contains the next portion of input data sequence to be encoded.</description>

      <description>The length-distance pair indicates that each of the next length characters is the same as the character exactly distance characters behind it in the original data stream.
In LZ77 algorithm, the compressor searches back through the search buffer until it finds a match to the first character in the look-ahead buffer. There could be more than one matches exist in the search buffer, and the compressor will find the one match having the longest length.</description>
