      <description>zlib is a free, open source software library for lossless data compression and decompression. It was written by Jean-loup Gailly (compression) and Mark Adler (decompression), in C language. The first version of zlib was released in May 1995. Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler also wrote the code for gzip (GNU zip). Under the hood, gzip uses zlib library.
To date, zlib is mainly maintained by Mark Adler, and its recent updates and version releases can all be found on GitHub.</description>
