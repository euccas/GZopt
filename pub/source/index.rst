Understanding ZLIB
============================================

This document covers technical introduction to the design and implementation of zlib. It's part of the outcome from my study on zlib while working on a project which aims to optimize zlib's performance in the compression part. The purpose of this document is to help those who are interested in zlib to better understand it.
